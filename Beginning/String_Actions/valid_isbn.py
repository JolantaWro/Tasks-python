"""
The ISBN-10 verification process is used to validate book identification numbers. These normally contain dashes and look like: 3-598-21508-8
The ISBN-10 format is 9 digits (0 to 9) plus one check character (either a digit or an X only). In the case the check character is an X, this represents the value '10'.
